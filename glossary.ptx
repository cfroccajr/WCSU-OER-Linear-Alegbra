            <p>
                An <em>augmented matrix</em> is a matrix to which a vector or another matrix has been appended. E.g.
                <me>

            <p>
A set of vectors <m>\mathcal{B}=\left\{\vec{v}_1,\, \vec{v}_2,\, \ldots\, \vec{v}_n\right\}</m> is a <em>basis</em> for a vector space <m>V</m> if every vector in <m>V</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>\mathcal{B}</m>.  The basis is called <em>orthonormal</em> if each vector has unit length and each pair of distinct vectors are orthogonal.

                <title>Change of Basis Matrix</title>
            <p>
                A <em>change of basis matrix</em> (also sometimes called a <em>change of coordinate matrix</em>) converts coordinates for a vector written in terms of one basis into coordinates in a different basis.  In particular if <m>\mathcal{E}</m> is the standard basis, and <m>\mathcal{B}=\left\{\vec{v}_1,\, \vec{v}_2,\, \ldots\, \vec{v}_n\right\}</m> is any other basis then the matrix
                <me>
                    \mathcal{P}_\mathcal{B}=
                    \left[
                        \vec{v}_1\, \vec{v}_2\, \cdots\ \vec{v}_n
                    \right]
                </me>
                converts vectors from <m>\mathcal{B}-coordinates</m> to <m>\mathcal{E}-coordinates</m>.

                <title>Column Space</title>
            <p>
                The <em>column space</em> of a matrix is the span of the columns of the matrix when viewed as vectors.  If the matrix represents a transformation then the column space is equivalent to the <em>image</em> of the transformation.

            <p>
                A <em>consistent system</em> is a system of equations, a vector equation, or matrix equation for which there is at least one solution.  If no solution exists we say the system is <em>inconsistent</em>.

                A <em>vector</em> is a one dimensional array of numbers.
                E.g.
