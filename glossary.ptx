                An <term>augmented matrix</term> is a matrix to which a vector or another matrix has been appended. E.g.

            <p>
A set of vectors <m>\mathcal{B}=\left\{\vec{v}_1,\, \vec{v}_2,\, \ldots\, \vec{v}_n\right\}</m> is a <term>basis</term> for a vector space <m>V</m> if every vector in <m>V</m> can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the vectors in <m>\mathcal{B}</m>.  The basis is called <term>orthonormal</term> if each vector has unit length and each pair of distinct vectors are orthogonal.

            <title>characteristic polynomial</title>
            <p>
                The <term>characteristic polynomial</term> of a matrix <m>A</m> is the determinant of the matrix <m>A-xI</m>, where <m>x</m> is a variable and <m>I</m> is the identity matrix.  The roots of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvectors of the matrix.

                <title>change of basis matrix</title>
            <p>
                A <term>change of basis matrix</term> (also sometimes called a <term>change of coordinate matrix</term>) converts coordinates for a vector written in terms of one basis into coordinates in a different basis.  In particular if <m>\mathcal{E}</m> is the standard basis, and <m>\mathcal{B}=\left\{\vec{v}_1,\, \vec{v}_2,\, \ldots\, \vec{v}_n\right\}</m> is any other basis then the matrix
                <me>
                    \mathcal{P}_\mathcal{B}=
                    \left[

                    \right]
                </me>
                converts vectors from <m>\mathcal{B}-coordinates</m> to <m>\mathcal{E}-coordinates</m>.

                Given a matrix <m>A</m> the <term>classical adjoint of <m>A</m></term>, <m>adj(A)</m>, is the matrix whose <m>i,j^{th}</m> entry is the determinant of the <m>j,i^{th}</m> cofactor matrix of A, <m>det(A_{j,i})</m>.

                Given a matrix <m>A</m> the <term><m>i,j^{th}</m>-cofactor matrix</term>, <m>A_{i,j}</m>, is the matrix you get by deleting row <m>i</m> and column <m>j</m>.  For example:

            <p>
                The <term>column space</term> of a matrix is the span of the columns of the matrix when viewed as vectors.  If the matrix represents a transformation then the column space is equivalent to the <term>image</term> of the transformation.

            <p>
                A <term>consistent system</term> is a system of equations, a vector equation, or matrix equation for which there is at least one solution.  If no solution exists we say the system is <term>inconsistent</term>.

            <title>determinant</title>
            <p>
                The <term>determinant of a matrix <m>A</m></term>, <m>det(A)</m> is a value which represent how <m>A</m> scales a vector space.  So, a positive determinant greater than 1 indicates that the transformation is a stretch, a positive determinant less than 1 a compression, and a negative determinant indicates that the transformation is a reflection.  A determinant of 0 tells us that the transformation is non-invertible (singular).
