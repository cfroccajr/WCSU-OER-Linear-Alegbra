                Consider the following set of vectors:

                Because we can write these vectors in relation to each other in this way we say that they are <term>linearly dependent</term>.

                        A set of vecotors, <m>S=\left\{\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2,\vec{v}_3,\ldots,\vec{v}_n\right\}</m> is <term>linearly independent</term> if no single vector in the set may be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set.  Equivalently, if the homogeneous system of equations

            <p>
                In contrast to the example above here is a linearly independent:
                <me>
                    S=\left\{

                        \right],
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}

                            \begin{array}{r}

                    \right\}.
                </me>
                We could demonstrate this with a lengthy argument about what combinations are possible or not possible, but it is better to set up and solve the system of equations

                useing the techniques from <xref ref="section_basic_systems" /> to show that <m>a_1=a_2=a_3=0</m>, that is that there is only one solution to this system.  In fact a linearly dependent set of vectors always corresponds to a system with a free variable. Underdetermined systems like the first example above, which is really the same as <xref ref="underdetermined"/>, will always be linearly dependent.  A set of vectors which are linearly independent always correspond to a system which is overdetermined or which has the same number of variables as equations with no free variables like the vectors in <xref ref="system-example2"/> or <xref ref="overdetermined"/>.

                As mentioned above the vectors in <xref ref="overdetermined" /> are linearly independent, but the system is inconsistent, i.e. there is not solution in that example.  From the perspective of <xref ref="section_space_definitions" /> and in particular the example in <xref ref="subspace_example_1" /> the point <m>(7,2,16)</m> is not in the plain determined by the vectors <m>[3,1,0]</m> and <m>[2,-1,4]</m>.  Convince yourself of this by altering the Sage code below to plot the appropriate plain and point:

            </sage>
            <p>
                The reason this happens is because the vectors <m>[3,1,0]</m> and <m>[2,-1,4]</m> do not form a <term>basis</term> for 3D space <m>\left(\mathbb{R}^3\right)</m>.

                        \end{array}
                    \right]
                </me>
                which is the same as <xref ref="basis_exercise_3" /> and so we know there is a solution.

                What this tells us is that we can apply the concept of basis to any type of vector space as long as it satisfies <xref ref="vector_space_def"/>.  Also, on a final note, for each vector space there is typically a basis which is considered the <term>standard basis</term><idx><h>standard basis</h></idx><idx><h>basis</h><h>standard basis</h></idx>.  For <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> it is 
                <me>
                    \mathcal{E}=\left\{
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                1 \\ 0 \\ 0
                            \end{array}
                        \right],
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                0 \\ 1 \\ 0
                            \end{array}
                        \right],
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                0 \\ 0 \\1
                            \end{array}
                        \right]
                    \right\}
                </me>
                and for quadratic polynomials it is
                <me>
                    \mathcal{E}=\left\{1,x,x^2\right\}.
                </me>
                We will see in <xref ref="section_coordinates" /> that we will be able to directly relate the standard bases with any other bases.
