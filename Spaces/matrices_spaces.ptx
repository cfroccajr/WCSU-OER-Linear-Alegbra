            <p>
                Consider the system of equations

                    <mrow>y-z\amp =0.</mrow>
                </md>
                Using the techniques we have studied this simplifies to

                so that the general solution is

                </md>
                If we write the solutions as vectors we get

                we get two more solutions.  What this tells us is that any multiple of a solution is a solution and any sum of two solutions is another solution; solutions therefore form a vector space of their own.  However since not all vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> are solutions to the system, the solutions are a subspace of something larger.
            </p>
            <p>
                What we see here is another way to think of solutions to a system of equations.  The solutions of a homogeneous system of equations form a subspace.  Therefore we can talk about a basis for the solutions and the span of the solutions.  This is another example of how one idea can be looked at from different perspectives.

            <title>A Universe in a Matrix</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    If we let
                    <me>

                    then there are three spacial subspaces associated with the matrix.  The <term>column space</term><idx><h>column space</h></idx> which is the set of all <m>\vec{b}</m> such that there is a solution for
                    <me>
                        A\vec{x}=\vec{b}.
                    </me>
                    The <term>row space</term><idx><h>row space</h></idx> which is the set of all <m>\vec{c}</m> such that there is a solution for

                    </me>
                    And, the <term>null space</term><idx><h>null space</h></idx> which is the set of all solutions to the homogeneous equation
                    <me>
                        A\vec{x}=\vec{0}.

                <title>The Null Space</title>
                <p>
                    The null space is the simplest to explain.  In this case it is precisely the set of solutions we found above
                <me>
                    Null(A)=
                    \left\{
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                -2 \\ 1 \\ 1
                            \end{array}
                        \right]t:
                        t\in\mathbb{R}
                    \right\}
                </me>
                which is a subspace of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.  Because of how matrix multiplication works the dimension the null space is in must always be the same as the number of columns in the matrix.

                <title>The Column Space</title>
                <p>
                    The column space is a little harder.  Consider the equation
                    <me>
                        A\vec{x}=\vec{b}\equiv
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{rrr}
                                1 \amp 3 \amp -1\\
                                0 \amp 1 \amp -1\\
                            \end{array}
                        \right]
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                x_1\\ x_2\\ x_3
                            \end{array}
                        \right]=
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                b_1\\ b_2
                            \end{array}
                        \right] 
                    </me>
                    We can write this as a linear combination of vectors from <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>
                    <me>
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                1\\ 0
                            \end{array}
                        \right]x_1+ 
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                3\\ 1
                            \end{array}
                        \right]x_2+
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                -1\\ -1
                            \end{array}
                        \right]x_3=
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{r}
                                b_1\\ b_2

                    </me>
                    Thus the column space, unlike the null space, is in this case in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  In general the dimension the column space is in is the same as the number of rows in the matrix.

                    The row space is similar to the column space, except you use rows, instead of columns. Consider the equation

                    Notice that the row space, like the null space, is in this case a subset of <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.  In general the dimension the row space is in will be equal to the number of columns in the matrix.

                    Consider the matrix which consists of the two vectors that define the row space and the one vector that defines the null space,
                    <me>
                        \mathcal{B}=
                        \left[
                            \begin{array}{rrr}
                                1 \amp 0 \amp -2\\
                                3 \amp 1 \amp 1\\
                                -1 \amp -1 \amp 1\\
                            \end{array}
                        \right].

                    If we row reduce this to its row reduced echelon form we get identity matrix (you should pause for a moment and make sure you can get that.)  This means that we could solve any equation of the form <m>\mathcal{B}\vec{x}=\vec{b}</m> and that it would have a unique solution for any <m>\vec{b}\in\mathbb{R}^3</m>.  That is, the three vectors that make up the columns of the matrix are linearly independent and form a basis for <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>.  This is a result that will actually be true for any matrix.

                    If you evaluate the code below you can see how the row space and null space complement each other to give us all of <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.  You can also see that we need three dimensions to draw them which is the number of columns we originally started with.  However, the null space here is a line, which is one dimensional.  The row space is a plane which is two dimensional.  So, the dimension of a space is not the same as the number of dimensions you need to draw or understand it.

                            Given an <m>m\times n</m> matrix <m>A</m> the row space is the set of all linear combinations of the rows and the null space is the set of all solutions to <m>A\vec{x}=\vec{0}</m>.  Bases for each taken together will form a basis for <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.

Each set is a basis and so are individually linearly independent.  If we were to assume we could write ...
