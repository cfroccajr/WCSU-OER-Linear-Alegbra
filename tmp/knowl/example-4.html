</h6>
<p>Just so that you don't get the idea that overdetermined is synonymous with inconsistent consider the homogeneous version of the system we just looked at:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
3x+2y \amp = 0\\
x-y \amp = 0\\
4y \amp = 0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>Note that if \(x=y=0\) then all three equations are true and we have a consistent system.  This illustrates an important property of homogeneous systems, they are always have at least one solution and so are consistent, you just need to make all the variables 0.</p>
<p>You should also be careful not to think that all under determined systems have infinitely many solutions, or even that they are consistent.  If we look at the system</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
s+t+r\amp = 2\\
-2s-2t-2r\amp = -10
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>and then multiply the second equation by -1/2 we get</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
s+t+r\amp = 2\\
s+t+r\amp = 5
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>clearly the sum of the three variables can not simultaneously be 2 and 5, so the system is inconsistent.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section_basic_systems.html#example-4">in-context</a></span>
