<p>We now have three different ways to write and think about systems of equations each with their on advantages and disadvantages.  Which works best depends on the situation and recognizing which to use where is something that comes with time and experience.  On a final note, as we will see more in <a href="section_matrix_operations.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: Matrix Operations">SectionÂ 3.2</a>, using matrix equations will allow us to recognize that solving the equations we are looking at now can be approached the same way as solving simple linear equations such as \(ax+b=c\) which makes them good for big picture ideas.</p>
