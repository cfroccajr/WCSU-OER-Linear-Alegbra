<span class="type">Example</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.4</span> <span class="title">An Under Determined System</span>
</h6>
<p>Consider the system of equations:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
t-4s+r \amp =0\\
s-2r \amp =0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>this system is called <dfn class="terminology">under determined</dfn> because there are more variables than equations.  However, we can still use the same strategies to try and solve it.  First we form an augmented matrix:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[
\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 \amp -4 \amp 1 \amp 0\\
0 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 0
\end{array}
\right].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>then we can try to simplify this as before:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[
\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 \amp -4 \amp 1 \amp 0\\
0 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 0
\end{array}
\right]
\stackrel{R_1+4R_2}{\Huge \leadsto}
\left[
\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 \amp 0 \amp -7 \amp 0\\
0 \amp 1 \amp -2 \amp 0
\end{array}
\right].
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>But, we can't go any further than this because there are only two equations for our three unknowns.  Consequently the solution we get is that \(t=7r\text{,}\) \(s=2r\text{,}\) and \(r\) may be any this we like.  For example if \(r=7\) then \(t=49\) and \(s=14\text{,}\) which we can see satisfies the original equation:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
49-4(14)+7 \amp =0\\
14-2(7) \amp =0
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>However we could also let \(r=1\) so that \(t=7\) and \(s=2\text{,}\) or let \(r=-2\) so that \(t=-14\) and \(s=4\text{.}\)  In fact we have infinitely many solutions since there are no restrictions on \(r\text{.}\)  In this situation we say that \(r\) is a <dfn class="terminology">free variable</dfn>.  Also, note that all the equations were set equal to zero, we call this a <dfn class="terminology">homogeneous</dfn> system and these will come to play a special roll in finding general solutions to systems of equations.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section_basic_systems.html#under_determined">in-context</a></span>
