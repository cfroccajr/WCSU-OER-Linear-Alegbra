<body><article class="example-like"><p>Of course if there can be under determined systems, then there can be <dfn class="terminology">over determined</dfn> systems as well.  Let's look to this system of three equations but only two unknowns:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
3x+2y \amp =7\\
x-y \amp = 2\\
4y \amp 16
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>note that the equations are not set equal to 0, so this system is <dfn class="terminology">non-homogeneous</dfn>. We could use the same technique of setting up an augmented matrix like so</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[
\begin{array}{rr|r}
3 \amp 2 \amp 7\\
1 \amp -1 \amp 2\\
0 \amp 4 \amp 16
\end{array}
\right],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>however in this case we can really solve this by inspection or observation, that is we just look at it for a minute.  From the last equation we conclude \(y=4\text{,}\) substituting that into the next equation up we get \(x=6\text{.}\)  However if we substitute \(y=4\) into the first equation we get \(x=-1/3\text{,}\) since \(x\) can't have two different values we conclude that this system of equations doesn't have a solution.  When a system doesn't have a solution we say that it is <dfn class="terminology">inconsistent</dfn>, other wise it is <dfn class="terminology">consistent</dfn>.</p></article></body>
