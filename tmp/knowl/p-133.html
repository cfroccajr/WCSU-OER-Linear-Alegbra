<p>If you evaluate the code below you can see how the row space and null space complement each other to give us all of \(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)  You can also see that we need three dimensions to draw them which is the number of columns we originally started with.  However, the null space here is a line, which is one dimensional.  The row space is a plane which is two dimensional.  So, the dimension of a space is not the same as the number of dimensions you need to draw or understand it.</p>
