<p>We should end this investigation with a note on looking before calculating.  The vector we want has a 1 in all three coordinates but of the three vectors on the right that we wish to combine only the first is non-zero in the third coordinate and only the third is non-zero in the second.  Therefore, we can conclude immediately that \(x=1/3\) and \(z=-1\text{,}\) from there it is easy to conclude that \(y=5/6\text{.}\)  You would have likely noticed this if I had written this as a system of equations like this</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
x+2y+z\amp =1\\
-z\amp =1\\
3x\amp =1
\end{align*}
</div>
<p>and so emphasizes the importance of viewing the same problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
