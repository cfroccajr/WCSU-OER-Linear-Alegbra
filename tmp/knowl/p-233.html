<p>These exercises are here to check your deeper conceptual understanding of the material and your ability to problem solve; they are not skill drills.  As such they are for homework and not test preparation, they would be far to long for an exam.  You need to complete each problem to the best of your ability.  Every answer you give needs to be your own work, needs to be written neatly on lined paper or typed, and at least the final answer for each should be a complete sentence.  Do not include a copy of the question with your solution, that is not needed to convey your thoughts clearly.</p>
