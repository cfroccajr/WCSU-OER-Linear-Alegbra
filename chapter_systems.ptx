This project is focused on creating a brief inquiry based text for 
use in a introductory course in cryptology for non-technical students.  
The material is presented, whenever possible, in a historically honest 
manner.

<!-- Introduction -->

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this Unit/Chapter we will focus on solving systems of linear equations and how we can interpret those systems and their solutions from multiple perspectives.  The notes here correspond with the material in <url href="http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf#page=11">Hefferon Chapter 1: Linear Systems</url> and so they should be used together.
