This project is focused on creating a brief inquiry based text for 
use in a introductory course in cryptology for non-technical students.  
The material is presented, whenever possible, in a historically honest 
manner.

<!-- Introduction -->

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this unit we learn about determinants.  Our goal is to understand not only how to calculate determinants but more importantly to understand what determinants tell us about transformations both directly and through the calculation of eigenvectors.
